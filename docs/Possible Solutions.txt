Possible Solution:
- Every orchard has following attributes,
-- It has starting number of trees
-- Rate of trees regeneration/degeneration for a period
-- Path between 2 towns
- Every town has following attributes,
-- Projected apple consumption rate for a period, which is directly linked to number of tree available in orchards
- A period has following behaviours
-- it can be cycled
-- it has starting point, which is just before it's being cycled
-- it has end point, which is just after it's being cycled
- Cycle a period will do following tasks
-- Decide to open or close orchard dependant of following facts
--- ensure that orchard is not depleted to 0 when it is open, close it otherwise
--- get single or multiple network of open orchards
--- for each network, calculate what are towns consumption rate
--- using a graph algorithm, evaluate if we can push all required town's apple demand
---- possible algorithm including linear programming or Edmund Karp
---- from this process, we can find alternative routes if orchard is closed
--- close all orchards that are not required to cover towns demand, so they can be used for future period
--- move cycle forward which will in turn, push apples to towns and reduce number of trees in all open orchards
-- this whole process is going to be executed again for the next period until all periods are covered
